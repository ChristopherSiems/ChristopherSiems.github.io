Hello! And welcome to my blog! If you're here, I imagine you already know who I am so I will keep it brief. My name is Christopher Siems and I am a computer science, data science, and math student at Clark University. I have experience doing research work and am a published academic author, I have been a consultant and technician working with Clark's IT department, and I have been a teaching aid in computer science classrooms.

This blog and website replaces my previous website in a much more flexible and maintainable form. My previous site was little more than a landing page I built fully from scratch. I had ambitions of keeping it up to date with hand-rolled HTML blog posts, but that unfortunately is not as sustainable as I thought it would be for a busy person like myself. My ambitions were too great in the beginning but the silver lining for that is that it pushed me to learn how to use Jekyll, how to use Ruby, how to use GitHub actions, etc.. But more than learning, building this site was just fun.

I hope to keep this blog updated semi-regularly with things I have been up to. I am not certain exactly what topics will be covered; I will certainly cover life events for myself, but maybe I'll write reviews for movies or video games, maybe I'll share recipes I make, maybe I'll write poetry. Who knows!
