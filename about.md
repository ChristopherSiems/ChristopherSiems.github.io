Hi there, my name is Christoper Siems and welcome to my website and blog! There's not much here now but please check in every once in a while so you can keep up with what I'm all about

I am a computer science, data science, and math student at Clark University. Currently, I'm a junior at Clark pursuing my undergraduate degree. At Clark I have taken classes in a range of computing and math related topics such as:

- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Theory of Computation
- Stochastic Models
- Machine Learning
- Computer Organization
- Programming Languages
- Discrete Structures
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability & Statistics

My education and the skills acquired in my education have lead me to holding several work positions in fields related to my specialty. Some of the positions I have held are:

- Research Associate doing experimental research on distributed computing consensus algorithms
- Research Assistant doing programmatic data science work internally at Clark
- Technician and Consultant in IT
- Teaching aid in computer science classrooms

My proudest work, so far, was conducted in the Summer of 2024 when I was working as a Research Associate under Dr. Lewis Tseng. In this position I built a tool, check it out here: [https://github.com/ChristopherSiems/Racos-automation](https://github.com/ChristopherSiems/Racos-automation), for running highly configurable benchmarks on a set of distributed computing consensus algorithms. This work was used to benchmark Racos, a novel cloud computing consensus algorithm that implements erasure coding in leaderless cloud systems, along side other comparable algorithms (Paxos, Raft, etc.). This work resulted in a paper discussing Racos, which can be found online here: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698038.3698511](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698038.3698511).

As well, starting in the Spring of 2024 I had the honor of being the president of the Clark Community Computing Club. As president I lead the club executive board in arranging an running events for computer science, data science, and other technology interested students. We have hosted lectures, workshops, community events, and hackathons.

In my work and education I have acquired a number of skills and knowledge in areas that are very important for my coming career. These include and are not limited to:

- Programming Languages: Python, Java, Kotlin, JS, C#, Go, Lua, Shell, R, JSON, YAML, LaTeX, HTML, CSS, Liquid, Markdown, Graphviz, Mermaid.js
- Algorithms & Data Structures: Sorting, Searching, Graphs, Distributed Computing, Mappings
- Machine Learning: Neural Networks, Bayesian Techniques, Regression, $$k$$NN, $$k$$-means, Weka
- Technologies: Linux, Windows, MacOS, Command Line, Git, GitHub, SSH, Docker, Jupyter
- and more!

I am currently in the market for Summer internships and research positions, if you would like to get in contact me with me please reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-siems/) and feel free to download a copy of my [resume](assets/docs/resume_anon.pdf)!
